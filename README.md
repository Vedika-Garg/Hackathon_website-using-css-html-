i. Project description:-
TechRush – Hackathon 1.0 is a single-page, responsive event website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to promote a college-level hackathon. The homepage features an eye-catching background with the event name, tagline, and a brief introduction. It includes smooth navigation links to different sections like Event Details, Registration Form, and Contact Info. The Event Details section outlines the hackathon schedule, rules, and prize information using a clean, card-based layout. A registration form collects user inputs such as name, email, phone number, and college, with JavaScript handling basic form validation and displaying a success message upon submission. The site also provides organizer contact details and social media icons. It is visually styled with gradients, hover effects, and responsive layouts for better viewing on both desktop and mobile devices. The project is deployed using GitHub Pages for free public access.

ii. Technologies Used:-
~ HTML5 – For structuring the content and layout of the webpage.
~ CSS3 – For styling, layout design, responsiveness, and hover effects.
~ JavaScript – For handling form validation and displaying dynamic success messages.
~ Font Awesome – For adding responsive social media icons.

Once downloaded, navigate to the project folder and open the index.html file in any modern web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge to see the website in action. You can also open the project in a code editor like Visual Studio Code if you wish to make any changes or customizations. For deployment, upload the project files to a GitHub repository. Then, go to the repository's settings, find the "Pages" section, and configure GitHub Pages to serve the site from the main branch and root folder.
